# chrome-extensions
Creating the needed day-day chrome extensions here. Thanks to new AI editor - Cursor and my mentor Rohan Shravan for this idea

### 1. my-lecture-notes-extension
While I was finding it difficult to take down the notes during a lecture, I thought of creating a chrome extension that could record a lecture while i was listening to it, save the transcript and summarise the transcript into a neat lecture  notes and summary which I could refer to after the lecture. \
This chrome extension could record the audio while the lecture is going on, and then have this transcribe to text. The text is saved in the downloads folder(on windows, of course!). I could use ChatGPT later, to make lecture notes from the transcribed text. \
Voila! my lecture notes is ready!!
